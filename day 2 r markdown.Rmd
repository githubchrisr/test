## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Heading 1 (big)

## Heading 2 (smaller)

#this is a chunk of code
```{r}

```
###Vectors
A vector is a sequence of information. 
```{r}
two <- 2
two <- c(1,1)
two <- "to"
two <- c("en", "en")

two_2 <- 2

```
